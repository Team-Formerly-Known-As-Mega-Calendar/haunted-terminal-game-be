  You return to your home town, utterly defeated and now besieged by slightly-older bullies. You have no friends, have yielded no money from this technology, and you have no prospects. Oh, yeah, and your "friend", Miss Ghost? She haunts you for the rest of your life, but continually reminds you that the truly scary thing is the continually abysmal size of the Gender Wage Gap.
